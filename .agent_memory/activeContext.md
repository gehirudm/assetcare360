# Active Context

## Current Focus
Budget step correctness — ensuring fault tickets cannot progress to work-in-progress while budget approval is pending, and that the UI displays sensible values when no/zero budget is set.

## Recent Changes (April 6, 2026)

### Budget Step Fixes
1. **`BudgetReportController.php`** — `create()` and `update()` now reject `total_amount <= 0` (changed from `< 0`). Error message: "Total amount must be greater than zero".
2. **`TicketWorkUpdateController.php`** — Added `BudgetReport` model dependency. Before creating a work update, checks latest budget report for the ticket: if status is `pending`, returns 400 "Cannot submit work update: the budget report for this ticket is still pending approval."
3. **`fault-ticket-detail/script.js`** `renderBudgetStep()` — When `total_amount` is 0 or missing, displays `—` instead of `LKR 0.00`.

### TecFaultRepairTicketController.php errors fixed
- Replaced all `Response::badRequest()` calls with `Response::error('…', 400)` — `badRequest()` does not exist on the `Response` helper.

### Instructions file fix
- `memory_bank_instructions.md` renamed to `memory_bank.instructions.md` so VS Code Copilot detects it.

## Active Decisions
- Budget `approved`/`rejected` both move ticket back to `Assigned` (intentional — technician proceeds from assigned state after review)
- `petty_cash_limit` is a `SystemSetting` value (seeded at 50000.00); drives `approval_level` (supervisor / maintenance_manager)

### TO Dashboard UI Polish (latest session)
- Removed **Recent Activities** section from dashboard
- Added **Notifications** nav item with red `.nav-badge` (actionable-count only)
- Added Notifications content section with `loadNotifications()` in `script.js`
- Stripped box/shadow wrapper from `.content-section` (now transparent on stone-100 bg)
- Bumped `.main-content` padding to `40px 30px 30px 36px`
- Documented full TO dashboard stylesheet into `.agent_memory/dashboard-styling-guide.md` for reuse across other role dashboards

## Next Steps
- Run pending migration `047_create_system_settings_and_budget_approval.php`
- Update `testing/openapi.yaml` with any API changes from budget fixes
- Verify frontend budget-step form validates `total_amount > 0` before submitting
- Use `dashboard-styling-guide.md` as template when building Supervisor / Manager / Admin dashboards
